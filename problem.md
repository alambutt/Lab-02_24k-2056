**ALGORITHM**\
Task # 01\
Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number(i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.
1. Ask the user to enter Nth number
2. Ask the user to enter n number
3. Set Div= n/Nth
4. If Nth * Div = n
5. Display Nth is a divisor of n
6. Set n = Nth/2
7. If (n * 2 = Nth)
8. Display Nth is even
9. Else Nth is odd
10. Set Nth = n/2
11. If (Nth * 2 = n)
12. Display n is even
13. Else n is odd
14. Else n is not the divisor of Nth
